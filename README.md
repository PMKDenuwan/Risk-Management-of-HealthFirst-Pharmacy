HealthFirst Pharmacy – Risk Assessment & Demo Web Application
📌 About the Organization

HealthFirst Pharmacy is a trusted provider of local healthcare, with the mission of caring for every person who walks through the door. Patients depend on HealthFirst daily for:

Quality prescriptions

Insightful and caring advice

A warm sense of service

This personalized care is supported by a comprehensive digital infrastructure that ensures smooth operations while maintaining patient records securely.

At the core of its operations are three critical systems:

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System – Stores medical histories, prescriptions, and treatment plans for accurate and real-time patient care.

Patient Prescription Database – Manages medications, dosages, and refills while ensuring safe prescription handling and preventing drug interactions.

Inventory Management System (IMS) – Tracks medicine stocks, sends alerts for low supplies, and supports financial management by monitoring supplier transactions.

Together, these systems ensure HealthFirst delivers safe, efficient, and personalized care.

🛡️ Risk Assessment

As part of this project, we conducted a Risk Assessment of HealthFirst Pharmacy’s digital infrastructure, focusing on identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts.

My responsibility was specifically on the Inventory Management System (IMS).
The assessment covered:

Risks of stock mismanagement (overstocking/understocking)

Data integrity risks in supplier transactions

Unauthorized access to IMS data

System downtime risks impacting medicine availability

Possible integration failures with EMR and Prescription Database

👉 These findings help in building a safer and more reliable IMS for HealthFirst Pharmacy.

💻 Demo Web Application

To demonstrate how these systems work in practice, we developed a demo web application using:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

The demo simulates the operations of:

EMR System

Patient Prescription Database

Inventory Management System (My part)

This allowed us to visualize how digital healthcare systems interact while highlighting potential risks and improvements.
